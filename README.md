Customer Segmentation Analysis Using K-Means Clustering
This project performs a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the 'Mall_Customers.csv' dataset. 
The dataset includes customer demographics such as age, annual income, and spending score.
The data is first standardized, and the optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method. 
Clusters are identified and visualized in both 2D and 3D plots to show the distribution of customers across different segments.
Additionally, we analyze the number of customers in each category within each cluster and visualize the average annual income and spending score per cluster.
We also estimate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for each cluster and identify potential churn based on spending scores and income levels. 
The project further explores hypothetical personalized marketing campaigns tailored for each customer segment to enhance business strategies. 
This analysis provides valuable insights for businesses to understand their customers better and optimize marketing efforts accordingly.
